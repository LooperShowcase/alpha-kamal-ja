    Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] (listen)),<br/>
     commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]),<br/>
    is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain,<br/>
    that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.<br/>
    Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper,<br/>
 the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto<br/>
  "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs,<br/>
   the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world,<br/>
    worth $4.76 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue,<br/>
     with an annual turnover of €582.1 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça",<br/>
      written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in<br/>
       dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.<br/>
   Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey,<br/>
   thirteen Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles,<br/>
   as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football,<br/>
    the club has won twenty European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles,<br/>
     a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three<br/>
      Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was ranked first in<br/>
       the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for<br/.>
     1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the sixth position on the UEFA club rankings <br/>
     as of July 2022. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between<br/>
      the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.<br/>
Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the<br/>
 largest social media following in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won<br/>
  a record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a <br/>
  record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo,<br/>
   Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy<br/>
    (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world<br/>
     in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.<br/>
      Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.<br/>
Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated<br/>
 from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.<br/>
  In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga,<br/>
   Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win<br/>
    six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup,<br/>
     and FIFA Club World Cup.[11] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.<br/>
      This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered<br/>
       by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League<br/>
        trophy in 2015, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.
